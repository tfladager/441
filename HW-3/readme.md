What I created
    The work I coded was pretty simple and copy/paste. It feels like there should be something happening but it is all in the console portion.

What AI created
    Wow. It is busy! I used Geminia and there's just a lot! Meta name, flex direction, container design commands, the image source code is complex with a wild, what I would assume to be a color code possibly?
    The console log portion of Java Script does have a smart design with the artist name inside and then just text below.

How would I feel?
    If I relied on AI or someone else to produce my code, I would try to start learning what it was right from the start, otherwise, there would be no way to be confident about it. 

Explain work?
    No, I struggle to explain what I do following these directions so there would be no way I could fully explain what AI did. I can kind of make out some stuff now - kind of like trying to read french or spanish - but it is not fluent by any stretch of the imagination.

Would it feel like my own?
    Mmmm. Not really. There would be a smidge bit of my direction in there or maybe a bit more but the metric that says AI does 75% and I do 25% would be more accurate of a descriptin.
