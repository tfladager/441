I enjoyed working with Gemini on this. Of course the initial assignment was just automatically done. I was able to slow the program down and get it to ask me questions and make me think. That was enjoyable. Good way to learn. I asked questions about each piece. I feel confident with this tool that I could do quite a bit. It took me quite a while though. I spent a considerable amount of time getting to this point but I really do feel like I am gaining ground.
